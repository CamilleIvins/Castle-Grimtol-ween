## Castle Grimtol 

> Halloween Hackathon 23 Starter Repo

### How to Use this Secret

Castle Grimtol used to be one of the checkpoints given out at Codeworks. It was a text based adventure game students would build to sharpen their skills with console applications. As time when on, console apps became less of a focus and much like the story this checkpoint was forgotten. Students only ever heard rumors of it.

Anything on this website is up for grabs. It's images, sounds, colors and stories are for you to use. Either literally or as inspiration. Staying close to Grimtol's origin you could build a text based adventure, a game set in the universe. Alternatively branch out and build a project based around one of the characters, or even a character you could imagine living in this world. The baker could use a delivery app for their goods. The Knight might want a dashboard tracking crimes. Whatever the project may be come up with a way to tie it back to Grimtol.


### Requirements

If you want your project judged and eligible for prizes; You must fork this repository and push your to the linked fork. You can re-name it what ever you would like and get rid of any assets you are not using. This ensures each project was started and completed by the accepted time and keeps all of the projects created for this hackathon linked together.

Good Luck and remember to have fun!


### The Legend of Castle Grimtol

In a distant realm a there was a kingdom. It contained a great city that thrived through advancements in science and magic for it's people. Its schools and colleges we know across the land. All this research and knowledge lead to bustling trade, full fields each harvest and of course happy people... But not everyone shared this vision of growth.

One day a dark cloud fell upon the land. The beloved king, who had ruled with kindness for many years, fell ill. Confident in his peoples abilities, he offered a generous reward to anyone who could heal him, with the sole desire of continuing the growth of the kingdom. Many healers and sorcerers tried but non could aid him, the sickness was quite unnatural.

Until one morning, a mysterious stranger entered the royal court, claiming to not only possess the cure the king seeked but more. However the stranger's proposition was unlike any other. He promised to bestow upon him and the entire kingdom the gift of eternal life. All that was required was the construction of a tower that reached as high as the tallest mountain in the land. The king, seduced by the stranger's words, agreed without realizing the curse that accompanied the magic.

As years passed, the tower extended towards the clouds. As the tower grew so did the power of the strangers curse, transforming its inhabitants into grotesque and disfigured versions of their former selves.

Stories of the curse's grip spread to neighboring kingdoms, sparking fear. In response, several great druids were summoned to contain this monstrous affliction. In a solemn ceremony, they sealed city, it's inhabitants and the monolithic tower beneath the ground. With the once-thriving kingdom buried beneath the earth, Grimtol's grandeur and tragedy faded into forgotten history...

How will you proceed?
